# Hi Leboncoin team, happy reviewing! ðŸ‘‹

## Preliminary setup

After the usual npm install, you will also need to install `json-server` globally, for my mock API to work on your computer.<br />
`npm i -g json-server`<br />
[The package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app.

### `npm run startdb`

Runs the json-server fake API.

### `npm run test`

Runs my tests.


### Thanks for reviewing me and I'm looking forward to speaking with you!
